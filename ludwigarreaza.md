# Ludwig Arreaza

## My name is Ludwig Arreaza, I am 20 years old and I am a Computer Science major with a Minor in IT. I love playing soccer, focusing on my academics, and spending time with friends and family. My dream job would be a software engineer at a big company like Apple.

## My goal for this class is to learn how to properly make a website using established methodlogy, processes, and getting more experience with code. I hope to learn how to work with API's and come out of the class being capable to creating an maintaining a website/project.
