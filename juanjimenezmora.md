# Juan Jimenez Mora

## Hi my name is Juan Jimenez Mora and i am a undergraduate in UNCG majoring in Computer Science, I am currently a Juinior and just picked up a minor it IT. I love to play games during my free time and to sometimes play soccer which serves for a good way to do cardio and spend time with friends whenever we are free.

## My CSC340 Goals are to learn how to use everything i've learned so far and use API's and data bases to make a project that i will be proud of. My goal is to also learn and then expand my knowledge in software design and how to be a back end developer to efficiently use code to make good softwares.
